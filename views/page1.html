        Line 1: First, you import the app and BrowserWindow modules of the electron package to be able to manage your application's lifecycle events, as well as create and control browser windows.
Line 3: After that, you define a function that creates a new browser window with node integration enabled, loads index.html file into this window (line 12, we will discuss the file later).
Line 15: You create a new browser window by invoking the createWindow function once the Electron application is initialized.
Line 17: You add a new listener that tries to quit the application when it no longer has any open windows. This listener is a no-op on macOS due to the operating system's window management behavior.
Line 23: You add a new listener that creates a new browser window only if when the application has no visible windows after being activated. For example, after launching the application for the first time, or re-launching the already running application.
